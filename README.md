# opencart_phpstorm_autocomplete
Opencart 3.x autocomplete

I found main script in web space and modify it.

Maximum compatibility with OpenCart 3.x and PHPstorm 

Working all models in admin and catalog path. 

Basic $db,$user,$session etc included.

Just add at opencart root folder, change your catalog/admin foldrers name and run it!

It's free =)
